# CRUD-API

Simple CRUD API used an in-memory database underneath

### Prerequisites
1. Install Node.js
2. Clone this repo locally
3. Go to folder develop
4. To install all dependencies use npm install
5. Run server locally with npm run start

#### As of now, I have implemented two methods:
1. GET api/users - for retrieving a list of all users. The server returns a 200 status code along with records of all users.
2. POST api/users - for creating a record about a new user and storing it in the database. The server responds with a 201 status code and returns the newly created record.
